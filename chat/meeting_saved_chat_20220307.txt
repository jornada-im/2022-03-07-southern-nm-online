12:50:22 From Yohannes Getahun to Everyone:
	Hello!
12:50:42 From Yohannes Getahun to Everyone:
	Will this meeting be recorded and possibly shared?
12:51:49 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	@Yohannes - we do not record workshops
12:52:24 From Yohannes Getahun to Everyone:
	I understand. Thank you!

13:34:10 From Diana Macias to Everyone:
	what file type would you recommend for the metadata? Excel, word doc, some other file?
13:34:57 From Dawn Browning ARS to Everyone:
	Krikey.
13:35:57 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	@Diana, we recommend a plain text format (README.txt, for example). Plain text doesn't have platform or application dependencies, which facilitates preservation and sharing.
13:36:51 From David.Huber to Everyone:
	I label a new tab for metadata, that I convert to a txt file for a data DOI later on.
13:36:56 From Alesia Hallmark (co-instructor) to Everyone:
	@Diana: If you use a .txt format, you can also avoid that “this is an old version of Word. You may have lost data” message!
13:38:22 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	What is the VIM program he's using? Is this just like a notes app for apple?
13:39:05 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10
13:39:55 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	@Savannah, that's a great question. VIM is an open source text editor like Notepad on Windows and the default text editor on Mac. I will post a link to the VIM web page in the etherpad
13:42:28 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	Does that apply for dates too? i.e., separate columns for day, month, and year?
13:42:55 From Alesia Hallmark (co-instructor) to Everyone:
	Great question, Gregor. We’ll go over dates soon…
13:43:06 From Alesia Hallmark (co-instructor) to Everyone:
	in short, YES
13:43:21 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	Sounds good, thanks

13:46:45 From Nazanin to Everyone:
	I couldn't find the file
13:50:51 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	@Nazanin - did you use this link: https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2252083
14:02:01 From Julie Schlichte to Everyone:
	For plot 4 on data sheet 2 (2014), are we to assume 1978 is the correct year?
14:03:22 From Nazanin to Everyone:
	hi yes thank you so much
14:03:56 From Diana Macias to Everyone:
	Similarly, for plot 3 the date collected is incomplete
14:07:55 From David.Huber to Everyone:
	Looks like plot 3 for 2014 was actually formatted for day/month only but has year 2015 if expanded to mm/dd/yyyy format
14:14:48 From Alesia Hallmark (co-instructor) to Everyone:
	https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/03-dates-as-data/index.html
14:25:33 From David.Huber to Everyone:
	For data analysis and figures, how about combining columns of date,month,yrs?
14:25:41 From Julie Schlichte to Everyone:
	Haha maybe
14:25:44 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	I'll sign anything you put in front of me
14:26:59 From David.Huber to Everyone:
	Thx

	https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/05-exporting-data/index.html
14:31:45 From Diana Macias to Everyone:
	what would you recommend to use instead of commas?
14:31:54 From Diana Macias to Everyone:
	if you want to maintain it in csv
14:32:06 From Alesia Hallmark (co-instructor) to Everyone:
	semicolons are a common choice
14:32:28 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	Semicolons work well, or tabs
14:34:28 From Diana Macias to Everyone:
	do any of you use tsvs?
14:34:52 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	Demographic survey (please complete if you haven’t): https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DQPVFWD
14:35:16 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	@Diana, yes. Some data sources - I think for example the US Census - use TSV formats
14:36:01 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	Often the delimiter can be specified on import/export of a delimited text file into and out of Excel, R, and other applications
14:36:49 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	Back at 2:51
14:52:40 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	fine for me
14:52:47 From Habibur to Everyone:
	Looks good
14:54:25 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	Etherpad link (we will post SQL exercises there, and can share questions, resources, etc.): https://pad.carpentries.org/2022-03-07-southern-nm-online

	Link to the Zipfile on figshare: https://figshare.com/ndownloader/articles/1314459/versions/10
14:58:26 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	Should we open these in a txt editor or is excel fine
14:58:37 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	Excel is fine, too

	Line 42 in the etherpad
15:00:40 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	Questions on line 48-51
15:01:29 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	write something down in the etherpad chat? Or directly into the document? Sorry I'm not totally sure how to use it just yet
15:01:44 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	Please feel free to jot your thoughts directly in the etherpad. We will show how to save/export the etherpad later today
15:02:11 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	@Savannah that's a good question - you should be able to type right on the etherpad document directly
15:03:32 From Nazanin to Everyone:
	I'm not sure how to do it as well
15:05:21 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	@Nazanin, try clicking with your mouse into the document where the colored text is. You should be able to write automatically, but please message me if not.
15:06:18 From Nazanin to Everyone:
	thank you so much
15:21:26 From David.Huber to Everyone:
	Dawn, ARS, had to get admin to run
15:21:41 From Nazanin to Everyone:
	I don't have sqlite viewer
15:22:15 From Dawn Browning ARS to Everyone:
	@David.Huber I logged in as admin...but will try again.
15:22:46 From David.Huber to Everyone:
	Ah, I have to have IT install everything
15:22:47 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	Https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
15:23:05 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	@Nazanin if you follow along here you may be able to get it installed
15:23:48 From Nazanin to Everyone:
	thank you because  I follow up with mobile that's why it's difficult  thank you for your understanding
15:26:12 From David.Huber to Everyone:
	ARS, IT just had to install it for my computer is all
15:26:27 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	Please do message a helper with additional installation questions
15:38:11 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	could you add all three at once, or does that make SQLite unhappy?
15:38:33 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	I tried and it didn't seem to like it - it only took the first one
15:38:42 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	I think...
15:38:48 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	ok, thank you!
15:39:22 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	yep, tables can be imported from CSV one at a time
15:40:11 From Darren James (Helper) to Everyone:
	@Gregor were you able to import "surveys.csv" by itself?
15:41:03 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	But for a reproducible workflow, you could write a SQL script that would automatically import CSV files into new copies of a database. So it doesn't have to be done manually.
15:41:40 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	@Darren - yes, thanks
15:42:30 From Christopher Vito to Everyone:
	What is the difference between real and numeric? I understand that integer shouldn't include decimals
15:43:28 From Dawn Browning ARS to Everyone:
	which csvs?
15:43:44 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	Plots and species
15:44:07 From Nazanin to Everyone:
	nu.eric digit is a single symbol
15:44:18 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	I had the same question, Chris, thanks for asking
15:45:40 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/00-sql-introduction/index.html
15:47:06 From Christopher Vito to Everyone:
	Ok, thanks!
15:51:02 From Diana Macias to Everyone:
	why would you add a new field in sql and not on the raw csv data file?
15:54:14 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	What new field did we add to our portal_mammals database?
15:54:23 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	or was that a more general question
15:54:25 From Gayle Tyree (they/them) to Everyone:
	common_name
15:54:32 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	thank you!
15:54:36 From Gayle Tyree (they/them) to Everyone:
	Or some such! :)
15:55:32 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	It was common_name
15:56:08 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	But we won’t use that down the road
15:58:48 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	is the semicolon signifying the end of the query?
15:59:06 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	Yes - exactly. Semicolons finish a query
15:59:29 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	👍
15:59:45 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	is --- how you annotate code in SQL
15:59:55 From Dawn Browning ARS to Everyone:
	This is SO helpful and a great way to learn SQL interactively. @Ruben Baca
16:00:18 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	— yes this is a comment in SQL (prefix with two dashes)
16:01:17 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	Great, thanks for explaining that Jon
16:02:39 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	Is Jon's mic spotty for anyone else?
16:02:45 From Carla Gavilan to Everyone:
	yesp
16:02:46 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	yeah
16:02:49 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	I'm having a little trouble hearing
16:02:49 From Gayle Tyree (they/them) to Everyone:
	Ja
16:02:49 From Lauren Cohen to Everyone:
	yes
16:02:51 From Julie Schlichte to Everyone:
	yes
16:04:39 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	/* This is a
16:04:45 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	Multiline comment */
16:07:10 From Gayle Tyree (they/them) to Everyone:
	I'm getting this error with the LIMIT command. Anyone else?
16:07:11 From Gayle Tyree (they/them) to Everyone:
	Execution finished with errors.	Result: near "LIMIT": syntax error	At line 7:	LIMIT
16:07:51 From Darren James (Helper) to Everyone:
	@Gayle Can you post your SQL code in the chat?
16:07:53 From Casey Wagnon to Everyone:
	When we save the database does it save the code?
16:08:12 From Gayle Tyree (they/them) to Everyone:
	SELECT *	FROM surveys;	LIMIT 10;
16:08:45 From Alesia Hallmark (co-instructor) to Everyone:
	@ Gayle: delete the first semicolon
16:08:57 From Darren James (Helper) to Everyone:
	@ Gayle I think you need to specify columns:
16:08:57 From Darren James (Helper) to Everyone:
	select year, month, day 	from surveys 	limit 10;
16:09:32 From Gayle Tyree (they/them) to Everyone:
	Did the trick! Thanks Darren and Alesia!
16:10:13 From Darren James (Helper) to Everyone:
	@Gayle I was wrong--like @Alseia said the culprit was the extra semicolon
16:10:13 From Casey Wagnon to Everyone:
	Thanks
16:12:57 From Diana Macias to Everyone:
	can you repeat the q? lol
16:13:17 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	Write a query that returns the year, month, day, species_id and weight in mg.
16:13:40 From Dawn Browning ARS to Everyone:
	can you scroll up  to see lines or expand the top window and decrease the bottom one?
16:18:24 From Trevor Roberts to Everyone:
	Are ‘’ and “” equivalent in sql?
16:18:56 From Casey Wagnon to Everyone:
	Can you save queries as new datasets?
16:19:33 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	I'd like to second Trevor's question!
16:22:47 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	yes
16:26:21 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	Exercise: Produce a table listing the data for all individuals in Plot 1 that weighed more than 75 grams, telling us the date, species id code, and weight (in kg).
16:26:45 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	I tried to also add an "AND (year >= 2000)" field and it did not work, do you have to choose between or/and commands or did I do something wweird?
16:34:10 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	I'm curious if it is best practice to do some of this subsetting here in SQL browser or in R from a raw data file? Or rather, in what cases should you manipulate data here in SQL prior to use in data analysis?
16:37:14 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	Either is fine Gregor, it really depends on your workflow. If you are using a database for your data, then it makes sense to do the subsetting with SQL (and you can do it in tandem with R as we will see tomorrow). But if your data are in raw data files you can bypass the database and just use R
16:38:20 From Diana Macias to Everyone:
	is there a cheatsheet with sql commands?
16:39:37 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	There are many: https://learnsql.com/blog/sql-basics-cheat-sheet/
16:39:57 From Gayle Tyree (they/them) to Everyone:
	So it's not a problem if names of different objects are duplicated? I'm referring to 'species' as the name for both a dataset and a column name
16:41:48 From Gayle Tyree (they/them) to Everyone:
	Great! Thanks Jon!
16:42:53 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	Far out, thanks Greg and Jon
16:42:57 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	@Gayle There are also aliases (AS) to give fields or tables a unique name within a query, which can be handy and we will probably touch on it tomorrow.
16:43:25 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	Data Carpentry SQL reference: https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/reference.html
16:45:08 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	A direct link to the DataCarpentry cheat sheet: https://datacarpentry.org/sql-ecology-lesson/files/sql-cheat-sheet.html
16:45:23 From Gayle Tyree (they/them) to Everyone:
	Also - when I run a query it looks like SQL flips through my past output before generating one from a new command. Is that taxing on processing speed at all? (If I'm correctly interpreting what's happening, that is...)
16:46:12 From Gayle Tyree (they/them) to Everyone:
	Nm, I think I was just running all my code over and over instead of the last query!
16:47:37 From Gregory Maurer (Jornada LTER) to Everyone:
	That is probably what happened, this isn’t necessarily a problem since these are quick queries, but if your queries take a long time you might want to only rerun them when you need to.
16:48:17 From Gayle Tyree (they/them) to Everyone:
	Got it, thanks again Greg!
16:50:15 From Jon Wheeler (he/him) UNM to Everyone:
	Exercise: Let’s try to combine what we’ve learned so far in a single query. Using the surveys table, write a query to display the three date fields, species_id, and weight in kilograms (rounded to two decimal places), for individuals captured in 1999, ordered alphabetically by the species_id.
16:54:20 From Julie Schlichte to Everyone:
	Thank you! I was having trouble with the order of execution, but this made it very clear why I was getting errors!
16:54:28 From Carla Gavilan to Everyone:
	yay!
16:55:00 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	This code wasn't giving me any output, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
16:55:34 From Darren James (Helper) to Everyone:
	@Savannah can you paste your SQL code in the chat?
16:56:05 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	SELECT year, month, day, species_id, ROUND(weight/ 1000, 2)as weight_kg	FROM surveys	WHERE year = 1999	ORDER BY species_id, ASC;
16:56:23 From Dawn Browning ARS to Everyone:
	Paste link here?
16:56:36 From Alesia Hallmark (co-instructor) to Everyone:
	https://forms.gle/hTbWyEFqKYvRDc558
16:57:15 From Darren James (Helper) to Everyone:
	@Savannah just remove the comma after species_id on the ORDER BY statement
16:57:40 From Savannah Meadors (she/her/hers) to Everyone:
	nice! thank you that fixed it!
16:58:51 From Gregor Hamilton - UNM (he/him) to Everyone:
	Thanks Greg et al.!
16:58:56 From David.Huber to Everyone:
	Great, thanks all!
16:59:06 From Trevor Roberts to Everyone:
	Thanks!
16:59:11 From Julie Schlichte to Everyone:
	Thank you and see you tomorrow all
16:59:11 From Carla Gavilan to Everyone:
	Thanks!!!
16:59:18 From Nazanin to Everyone:
	thank you so much
